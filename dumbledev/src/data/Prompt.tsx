Generate a Project in React app. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, 
without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.
also you can use date-fns for date format and react-chartjs-2 chart, graph library

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

Hereâ€™s the reformatted and improved version of your prompt:

Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:

json
Copy code
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}
Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field lists all the filenames. Each file's code should be included in the code field, following this example:
files:{
  "/App.js": {
    "code": "import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className='p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center'>\n      <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500'>Hello, Tailwind CSS with Sandpack!</h1>\n      <p className='mt-2 text-gray-700'>This is a live code editor.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}"
  }
}
  
- get images from web/internet but only working not broken
-  Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.
